WHAT IS THIS?
spice.pm, an easy-to-use Perl5 library for parsing spice netlist.

WHAT IS SPICE
Spice is a circuit level design format/language for describing VLSI
designs at transistr level.

TRAGATED AUDIANCE
CAD persons and VLSI designers.

APPLICATIONS
   This release
      o Extracting the hierarchy.
      o Traversing the netlist.
      o Creating html document for an easy naviagation of netlist.
      o any other appication, which requires netlist specific information.

   Future release
   Current version does not support more than one netlist open at a time.
   Future version, (Object Oriented Design) shall support this feature. It
   can help developing the following applications-
      o Comparing two spice netlists.
      o extracting the netlist difference.

INSTALLATION
To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this README
file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If this doesn't work for you, try:

   cp spice.pm /usr/local/lib/perl5

If you have trouble installing spice.pm because you have insufficient
access privileges to add to the perl library directory, you can still
use spice.pm. Add the following lines in your script-

$path2spice = "absolute_path_2_spice.pm_file" ;
BEGIN {push @INC, "$path2spice" ; }

If evrything fails, please contact me at srohit@cpan.org.

DOCUMENTATION
Type "perldoc spice" for a detailed documentation on the usage and other
internals.

EXAMPLES
Please see perl scripts files under examples/ directory.

TODO
   o Convert module design to OO style.
   o Build some more interface methods. Need feedback from the audiances.
